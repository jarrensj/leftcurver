People online made a new token after the new dog with the dog's name, Neiro. It's a common occurance for a lot of people to launch a token named the same thing or surrounding a similar theme when some event happens. 

Kabosu being so iconic and with a lot of tokens being launched around other people's dogs [and cats], a Neiro token drew in a lot of interest. 

Since there were a few tokens surround a simliar theme, there was a lot of discussion on which was the "best" one. Some that had bought the token that had launched first were upset because their token had provenance for being early but the market had chosen another Neiro token that launched (some Neiro tokens had more trading volume and a bigger market cap compared to the other tokens). 

There has been a lot of trading volume and volatility surrounding these crypto tokens.

We do not endorse any of these tokens. We're not affiliated with any of these tokens.  Please be careful and you are responsible for your own decisions.
